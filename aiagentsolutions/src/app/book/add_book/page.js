        We’re highly selective about the projects we take on to ensure we
        deliver maximum value for our clients. To respect everyone's time, we
        typically don’t take on projects with budgets below $5,000. Most of our
        work ranges from $6,000 to $12,000, depending on scope. Does this align
        with your anticipated budget?
